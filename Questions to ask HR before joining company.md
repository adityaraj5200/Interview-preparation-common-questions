Here’s a practical, realistic list of **questions to ask HR and things to verify before joining**, especially when you know the job is a stepping-stone and you want to avoid unpleasant surprises.

---

# ✅ **1. Employment Terms & Contract**

These affect your ability to resign or switch later.

### **Ask:**

* **What is the notice period?**
  (Is it the same during probation and after confirmation?)
* **Is the notice period negotiable or can it be bought out?**
* **Are there any bonds, clawbacks, or service agreements?**
  (e.g., training bond, relocation bond, certification bond)
* **Is there a probation period? What are the conditions to clear probation?**
* **What happens if someone resigns during probation?**

### **Why:**

Long notice periods, strict bonds, or “no buyout” policies can trap you.

---

# ✅ **2. Compensation & Benefits (Avoid Salary Surprises)**

Make sure everything is transparent.

### **Ask:**

* **What exactly is the CTC breakup?**
  (Basic, allowances, PF, variable pay, ESOPs—if any)
* **Is any part of the compensation *performance-linked* or *deferred*?**
* **How is variable pay calculated? How often is it paid?**
* **Is overtime compensated?** (If your role might demand it)
* **Exact take-home salary after deductions?**

### **Why:**

Many companies hide low take-home, delayed variable pay, or large PF deductions.

---

# ✅ **3. Work Expectations & Work Culture**

This prevents you from getting stuck in unreasonable workloads.

### **Ask:**

* **What are the working hours? Are they fixed or flexible?**
* **Is weekend work common? If yes, is it compensated?**
* **What are the expectations around overtime?**
* **What is the team structure and who will I report to?**
* **What tools/tech stack will I be working with?**
* **Is there a clear job description?**
* **Any additional responsibilities beyond the JD?**

### **Why:**

You don’t want to walk into a role where you become a general-purpose task machine.

---

# ✅ **4. Career Growth & Learning Opportunities**

Since your goal is to get experience and move on, you need clarity.

### **Ask:**

* **What kind of projects will I work on?**
* **Is there formal training or mentorship?**
* **Will I be allowed to switch teams/domains later if needed?**
* **What is the appraisal cycle and typical growth?**

### **Why:**

Some companies promise “great learning” but put you on support-only roles with no growth.

---

# ✅ **5. Remote/Hybrid/On-site Policies**

Companies often hide travel expectations.

### **Ask:**

* **Is it fully on-site, hybrid, or remote?**
* **If hybrid, what is the mandatory office attendance?**
* **Any chance these policies may change soon?**
* **If travel/relocation is required, who bears the cost?**

---

# ✅ **6. Leave Policies**

Many candidates are surprised after joining.

### **Ask:**

* **How many annual, sick, and casual leaves?**
* **Are unused leaves encashable or lapsing?**
* **Is unpaid leave allowed and what’s the approval process?**

---

# ✅ **7. Company Stability & Nature of Role**

Especially if the pay is already low.

### **Ask:**

* **Is the role permanent or contractual?**
* **Is payroll internal or through a third party?**
* **Has there been any recent restructuring/layoffs?**
* **What is the expected project duration?**

### **Why:**

Contractual payroll or unstable projects make switching harder and add uncertainty.

---

# ✅ **8. Exit & Relieving Process**

You want to leave smoothly when a better opportunity comes.

### **Ask:**

* **How does the exit process work?**
* **Is early release possible?**
* **How quickly does the company provide relieving & experience letters?**
* **Any penalties for early resignation?**

---

# 📌 **Bonus Tip: Ask for Everything in Writing**

Verbal promises ≠ valid assurance.

Make sure:

* Offer letter
* CTC breakup
* Job description
* Notice period
* Variable pay terms

…are all present in **official documents or emails**.
