## 📌 How to Use This

1. **Pick 2–3 major Amazon projects** from your resume.
2. Write down **bullet points under each STAR section** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
3. Practice answering interview-style questions by stitching them together.
4. For Amazon specifically, map your **Actions & Results to Leadership Principles** (Customer Obsession, Ownership, Deliver Results, etc.).
