* Could you walk me through the entire interview process (number of rounds, duration, and what each round focuses on)?
* Which team I am interviewing for? (Can guess the system design interview questions from it)
* Will there be an online assessment or does the process directly start with interviews?
* Will the interviews be virtual or onsite?
* Is there a system design round included? If yes, will it be high-level design (HLD) or low-level design (LLD)?
* How much time gap will I usually get between rounds to prepare?
* Are there behavioral/HR rounds, and how heavily do they weigh in the overall decision?
* What are the primary skills or tech stack the interviewers will focus on (Java, Spring, Distributed Systems, etc.)?
* Is there a feedback mechanism after each stage or only after the entire process?
* Could you tell me the compensation offered for this role and give breakdown of it?
